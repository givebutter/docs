title: "Pagination"

All resources that are retrieved as lists will be paginated. Paginated responses always have meta and links keys that contain information about the pagination's state.

```json
{
  "data": {
    // ...
  },
  "links": {
    "first": "https://api.givebutter.com/v1/campaigns?page=1",
    "last": "https://api.givebutter.com/v1/campaigns?page=1",
    "prev": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "from": 1,
    "last_page": 1,
    "links": [
      {
        "url": null,
        "label": "&laquo; Previous",
        "active": false
      },
      {
        "url": "https://api.givebutter.com/v1/campaigns?page=1",
        "label": "1",
        "active": true
      },
      {
        "url": null,
        "label": "Next &raquo;",
        "active": false
      }
    ],
    "path": "https://api.givebutter.com/v1/campaigns",
    "per_page": 20,
    "to": 1,
    "total": 10,
  }
}
```

Currently, the max number of results per page is always 20. To retrieve all results, you must programmatically loop through the pages and fetch results.
