title: "Authentication"

The Givebutter API uses API Keys to authenticate and perform requests. To authenticate requests, provide your API Key as the Bearer header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {{ your_api_key }}
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Unencrypted calls over HTTP are not supported and will fail.
